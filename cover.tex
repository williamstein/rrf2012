\section*{Proposal Abstract} 
This proposal is about a web application for doing mathematical
computation (based on Sage) called Salvus, which will be designed from
the start to be secure, highly available, horizontally scalable and
able to robustly handle up to 1,000 simultaneous users.  There will be
both free and non-free accounts, with revenue from the non-free
subscriptions supporting maintenance and purchase of hardware, and the
development of Sage.  This commercialization effort is a major and
risky new direction for the PI, which is mitigated by him working
closely with UW's Center for Commercialization to navigate the legal
and business minefields.
