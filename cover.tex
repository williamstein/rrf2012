\section*{Proposal Abstract} 
This proposal is about a web application for doing mathematical
computation (based on Sage) called Salvus, which the PI is
implementing from the ground up to be secure, highly available,
horizontally scalable and able to robustly handle up to 1,000
simultaneous users by March 2013 (with further scalable then being
primarily a matter of available hardware resources).  There will be
both free and non-free accounts, with revenue from the non-free
subscriptions supporting maintenance and purchase of hardware, cloud
hosting, and the development of Sage.  This commercialization effort
is a major and risky new direction for the PI, which is mitigated by
him working closely with UW's Center for Commercialization to navigate
the legal and business minefields.
